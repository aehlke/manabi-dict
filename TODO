TODO:

refactor style sheet resources, and look at the dictionary.app ones


better subbook handling?
when setting the search field to the result selected (like when they press enter), it should not include any special notation characters like the superscript 1 etc




custom horizontal scrollbar for webview so that it doesn't overlap the corner

TODO LATER:
on-hover of links, show the entry's title or something

shorter IDs for books. possibly store these in a dotfile in the epwing dir so it's not path-dependent

renamable labels for books

show the heading inside the text if there is no keyword in (or at the top of) the text

drag-n-drop for folders into the Preferences table to install a dictionary
?drag-n-drop reordering of dicts

combine ~suffix entries back into main entry somehow (probably per dictionary, after detecting which dict it is)



IDEAS:
allow multi select on the results list, to show multiple entries?


BUGS:
the sample test ej,je dict shows twice as many entries as it should (misdetermining entry endpoint)
resize book select on switch
mouse-wheel scroll focus is wrong for the entry's scrollbar (scroll down in results list all the way, then entry scrolls too)

epywing bugs:
need to change < and > to entities if theyre part of the text
'dame' in hiragana is broke in supa readers (see: kotonoko)
