TODO:

show the heading inside the text if there is no keyword in (or at the top of) the text

renamable labels for books

combine ~suffix entries back into main entry somehow (probably per dictionary, after detecting which dict it is)

drag-n-drop for folders into the Preferences table to install a dictionary
?drag-n-drop reordering of dicts


better subbook handling?
when setting the search field to the result selected (like when they press enter), it should not include any special notation characters like the superscript 1 etc



IDEAS:
allow multi select on the results list, to show multiple entries?


BUGS:
the sample test ej,je dict shows twice as many entries as it should (misdetermining entry endpoint)
resize book select on switch

epywing bugs:
need to change < and > to entities if theyre part of the text
