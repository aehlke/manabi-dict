How can I display rich text in a QTable? Simply use QSimpleRichText to draw the text in a reimplemented QTableItem::paint().

--------
history management

times to push to history:
 - search result clicked & current item changes
 - link clicked which loads a new entry
 - search result list changes after it had received focus on an entry.
   push the last entry that was highlighted, if it wasn't already pushed.
 - back is pushed, when results list had input focus

self.staged_back
 - up/down
 - first enter = enter which highlights a result
 - clicked, i guess

when to push staged_back:
 - search changes

when link is clicked:
 - push current entry

have to handle hash changes in history, not just entries

up/down changes results list
page up/page down scrolls entry view
